<p> Internet of Things (IoT) is a fast growing trend in technology. IoT provide devices access

to networks where they could be controlled and monitored from a local or remote location. Home

devices, doors, and lights are some of the things that can utilize IoT.</p>

<p>There are limited tools and resources for users to monitor and control their homes. Lights

are frequently left turned on when not needed. This form of idle energy consumption is a

waste of electricity. The home should also be a place of safety and privacy, but there are cases of

break-ins by intruders. This type of dangerous circumstance demands a measure of basic security

in the home.</p>

<p>This project configures the Raspberry Pi development board as a local controller that

connects to a server that utilized IoT. The local controller with sensor peripherals manages the

behavior of the home system. Users were able to access the home network locally or remotely to

monitor and control their devices. To reduce power consumption, automated features

were implemented to minimize the necessary operation time of each device. A two way

communication system allowed the local controller and server to interact. Sensors were installed

onto doors that alerted the users in cases of intrusion. The home monitoring system provided log

entries and notify the users on the status of their home. With the utilization of IoT, Raspberry Pi,

and a server, users were provided with more control over their homes.</p>
